Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This tokenizer provides the user a simple UI with a '$' mark to initiate
commands.
`$ like this`

// How it works:
This tokenizer works by divinding the user inputed string and storing the
pieces; maintaining a history.

// How to run it:
Use comman t to type a scentence into tokenizer
Use commant ! and a number to find history in that point
Use command h to print history

// Bugs user should know about:
Not checking if !num is within bounds, check by printing history
